  <ul>
    <li>Built a static cube by using a prefab of a cubie (one of the smaller cubes that make up the Rubik's cube), duplicating it, and then assembling them together.</li>
    <li>Implemented the ability to rotate the cube, allowing players to look around it.</li>
    <li>Created a cube map display at the top right of the screen which shows the current state of the cube.</li>
    <li>Added raycasts to read and store the state of the cube, which could then be passed to the cube map.</li>
    <li>Implemented side rotation and player interactivity by parenting the cubies around the centers that were being rotated, allowing players to manipulate and solve the cube themselves.</li>
    <li>Added automated movement functionality and a shuffle button to randomly mix up the cube.</li>
    <li>Implemented the Kochemba 2-phase method to solve the cube in under 23 moves.</li>
  </ul>
