<h1 align="left">Rubik's Cube</h1>

###

<p align="left">1. Built a static cube by using a prefab of a cubie (one of the smaller cubes that make up the Rubik's cube), duplicating it, and then assembling them together.<br>2. Implemented the ability to rotate the cube, allowing players to look around it.<br>3. Created a cube map display at the top right of the screen which shows the current state of the cube.<br>4. Added raycasts to read and store the state of the cube, which could then be passed to the cube map.<br>5. Implemented side rotation and player interactivity by parenting the cubies around the centers that were being rotated, allowing them to manipulate and solve the cube themselves.<br>6. Added automated movement functionality and a shuffle button to randomly mix up the cube.<br>7. Implemented the Kochemba 2-phase method to solve the cube in under 23 moves.</p>
